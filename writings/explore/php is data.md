# Goals

Define code and data in context of PHP.
Describe affordances in PHP ecosystem for treating code as data.

### Declarative programming

# At runtime

## Homoiconic parts

## var_export

## Reflection

# Not at runtime

## regex

## Parsing

## Static analysis

## Rector

## Using raw parsing

# Combined

## Autoloading
